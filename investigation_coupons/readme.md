# Summary of Findings

## Goals
The goal of this project is to use what you know about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.

## Findings

Specifically, I focused on those who received coupons for the Coffee House. 

Firstly, It appears that temperature has a significant effect on the amount of people willing to accept coupons. Contrary to assumption, the lower the temperature, the less likely people were willing to go to the coffee house and use the coupon.  It seems that most coupon uses are during hotter temperatures. Comparing this to occupation did not show a significant difference in what temperatures people were using the coupons.

It also seems that most yeses happened on sunny days. This was apparent because there are much more yeses on Sunny days as compared to other weather. Which seems opposite of what is expected. One would be expected to visit a Coffee Shop more often when it is cold, so that the coffee can warm you up. However this is not the case. Although it is entirely speculation, these people are likely getting frozen treats from the Coffee House

After further investigation, it was apparent that passengers who are alone or are with friends are MUCH more likely to use the Coffee House coupon. Having a child or partner seems to discourage people from visiting the Coffee House. 

It also seems like Unemployed, Students, Sales, and Computer & Mathematical occupations both receive and use the coupons much more often.  This was made apparent during investigation of the effects of occupation.

With regards to destinations, it seems that people on the way home don't seem to often use the coupons. This is also contrary to my expectation. However, those with no urgent place to be were nearly 2x more likely to accept the coupons than those on the way to work or home. This makes sense as a Coffee House is often a place to spend time relaxing, reading or working on a project. 

In regards to how quickly people are using the coupons, It appears that most uses are within 5 minutes of receiving the coupon. This implies that the coupon has had an impact on the customer and has worked to drive business as expected. As for those who use the coupon within 15 minutes, this frequency is halved, and 25 minutes seems to be more often a no. These findings imply that the quicker the customer uses the coupon, the more likely they are to use it. A customer who waits 25 minutes to use a coupon is much less likely to end up using it.

Finally, through investigation of students who accepted the coupon, I found that those with an income of 87500-99999 were extremely significantly more likely to accept the coupon.

In conclusion, we learned that temperature, destination, passengers, income, and occupation, all had a significant impact on whether the customer ends up using the coupon.
